In this guide, you'll learn how to create a range of buttons, focusing on both their design and functionality. The objective is to craft 10 to 15 different button variations, allowing you to demonstrate your creativity and skills in front-end development. This task is flexible in terms of difficulty; you can choose to create a mix of simple, intermediate, and advanced buttons based on your comfort and expertise level.

## üöÄ&nbsp; Getting Started

This project is aimed at solidifying your understanding of fundamental web development concepts by applying them in a project-based scenario. To get started:

1. **Clone this repository** to your local machine to begin working on your version of Booktory.
2. **Set up your environment** by ensuring you have a modern web browser and a code editor installed.

## ‚ù§Ô∏è&nbsp; Contributing to the Project

Booktory is a basic project designed for educational purposes. Contributions are welcome, especially from students and educators who wish to improve the project or suggest new features. Whether you're fixing bugs, enhancing the application, or improving documentation, your input is valuable!

## üì´&nbsp; Support and Questions

Encountered a problem or have a question? While this project might not have a dedicated support channel, consider reaching out to your peers, instructors, or use online forums such as StackOverflow. Sharing and solving issues collectively is a great way to learn and grow.

## ü§ù&nbsp; Reporting Issues and Suggesting Features

Found a bug or have an idea for a new feature? Feel free to open an issue in this repository with a clear title and description. Contributions are always welcome, and your feedback helps improve Buttons for everyone.

## ‚úÖ&nbsp; Requirements

To work on this project, you'll need:

- A modern web browser capable of running JavaScript.
- A text editor or IDE for coding (e.g., VS Code, Sublime Text, Atom).

Knowledge in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is essential as you'll be working extensively with these technologies.

## Instructions

1. **Selection**: Begin by deciding on the complexity of the buttons you want to create. You have the freedom to mix and match different levels of difficulty. Whether you opt for easier options, more complex designs, or a combination of both is entirely up to you.

2. **Source Buttons**: Out of the total buttons you plan to create, at least 5 must be selected from the `button_options` folder located within the `1-buttons` directory. This requirement is designed to challenge your ability to integrate predefined designs into your project.

3. **Customization**: You will need to add your own SASS file(s). 

4. **Implementation**: After creating your buttons, the next step is to incorporate one or more of these button styles into a calculator web application. This application should not only be functional but also visually appealing, making it a standout piece in your portfolio. You can find this in the `2-calculator` folder in the.
